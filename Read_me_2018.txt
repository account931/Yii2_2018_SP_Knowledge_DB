#Yii2 application for Support CR knowledge base, Support cases/hour rates, point merge + Yii2 Day Book.

#This Yii2 was built on base of previous Yii2 Geocoding app (which included Geocoding time logs, etc), i,e not to mess to much I just copied Yii2 Geocoding app, 
  commented old Nav links and created new Nav links to new Controller, i.e it means that all old models/views/controllers are still in this folder, they are just not used.

#It contains all Model/Views/Controllers files from Yii2 Geocoding (which were on hostinger (waze.ese.es/2), just links to them are commented in menu.)+ new supp mvc files (supp time logs, knowledhe base, point merge).
